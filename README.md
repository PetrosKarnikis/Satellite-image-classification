# Satellite-image-classification
Develop a model that accurately classifies new satellite images describing cloudy, desert, green area, and
water. the project also includes a comparative study of other algorithms. Compare the performance of
state-of-the-art classifiers such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), support vector machines (SVM),
desision trees (DT), and random forests (RF)
